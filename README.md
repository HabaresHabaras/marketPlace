To start open the parent directory and write on the command prompt, node marketplaceCustomer.js. 
Then you'll be prompted hello, and you'll see three options to chose from:

  -WEAPONS:
  
  -SHIELDS:
  
  -GOODIES:

Select any of these to list the items in the department with the same name as the option selected out of these three and allow the user to select which one they want to purchase and how much of it they'd like to buy.
